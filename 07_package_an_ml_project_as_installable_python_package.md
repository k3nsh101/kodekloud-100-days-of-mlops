### Task

The xFusionCorp Industries deployment team needs the fraud-detection model code packaged as an installable Python distribution. A draft `pyproject.toml` exists at `/root/code/fraud-detection/`, but it does not build a wheel that meets the team's standard. Correct the file and produce a compliant package.

1. The project at `/root/code/fraud-detection/` already contains the source code under `src/fraud_detection/`. The Python files are complete—you do not need to modify any of them.

2. The corrected `pyproject.toml` must satisfy every one of the following:
   - it declares a `[build-system]` section with `requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]` and `build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"`;
   - `name` is `fraud_detection` (the distribution name must match the module path under `src/`);
   - `version` is `0.1.0`;
   - `requires-python` is `>=3.10`;
   - `dependencies` is `["scikit-learn", "pandas", "numpy"]`.

3. Review the existing `pyproject.toml` and correct everything that does not match the requirements above.

4. Build the package from the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /root/code/fraud-detection
   python3 -m build
   ```

5. The build must produce a wheel named `fraud_detection-0.1.0-\*.whl` under `dist/`.

The `build` package is already installed. Use `python3` rather than `python`.

### Solution

- Change directory into the project directory.

  ```bash
  cd fraud-detection/
  ```

- pyproject.toml

  ```
  [project]
  name = "fraud_detection"
  version = "0.1.0"
  description = "Fraud detection model for xFusionCorp Industries"
  requires-python = ">=3.10"
  dependencies = ["scikit-learn", "pandas", "numpy"]

  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
  build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

  [tool.setuptools.packages.find]
  where = ["src"]
  ```

- Build

  ```bash
  python3 -m build
  ```
