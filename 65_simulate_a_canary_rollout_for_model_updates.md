### Task

The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team practices canary rollouts using a pure-Python simulator before integrating the same traffic-split strategy into Argo Rollouts. The `canary_deploy.py` scaffold located at `/root/code/serving/` is responsible for monitoring the v2 error rate and steering the rollout. However, the canary policy, including the phase-weight ramp and rollback threshold, has not yet been implemented. Your task is to develop the canary policy in `canary_deploy.py` to ensure that the simulator effectively ramps traffic from 95/5 to 70/30 and finally to 0/100, concluding with the outcome `OUTCOME: PROMOTED` under healthy v2 conditions.

1. The project layout under `/root/code/serving/`:
   - `canary_deploy.py` – Defines `CanaryDeployer` with `promote()`, `rollback()`, and `send_requests()`, plus a `main()` that runs three phases and rolls back if the v2 error rate exceeds `ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD`. `send_requests()`, `rollback()`, and `main()` are wired; `promote()`'s phase-weight ramp and the `ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD` value are left as `TODO`s. No network or model is used; the v2 error rate is simulated at 2 % per request via a seeded `random.Random(seed=42)`.

2. The end state must include:
   - `ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD` is set to a value that keeps the healthy v2 rollout (simulated at a 2 % error rate) above the bar so it promotes rather than rolls back.
   - `promote()` ramps the weights across the three phases: phase 1 → 95/5; phase 2 → 70/30; phase 3 → 0/100.
   - Running the script prints three `Phase N: lines`, a `Total requests: 300` line, and ends with `OUTCOME: PROMOTED`.
   - The phase-2 log line shows `v1_requests` > `v2_requests`.

Managed canary controllers such as Argo Rollouts, Flagger, and Linkerd ship with a small default rollback threshold—set high enough it lets a broken v2 do meaningful damage before the rollout halts, too low and a healthy rollout is aborted on noise.

### Solution

- Change directory

  ```bash
  cd serving/
  ```

- Update `canary_deploy.py`

  Change `ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD` and update `promote()` function

  ```python
  """Canary-deployment simulator for the fraud-detection model.

  Runs a three-phase traffic-split rollout from the stable v1 to the
  candidate v2:

    Phase 1 — 95 % v1 / 5 % v2   (initial canary wedge)
    Phase 2 — 70 % v1 / 30 % v2  (confidence ramp)
    Phase 3 — 0  % v1 / 100 % v2 (full promotion)

  Each phase fires `REQUESTS_PER_PHASE` requests, routes them per the
  current weights, and measures the v2 error rate. If the error rate
  exceeds `ROLLBACK_THRESHOLD`, the deployer rolls back to 100 % v1
  and the simulation reports `ROLLED_BACK`; otherwise it advances to
  the next phase. A clean three-phase run reports `PROMOTED`.

  Released canary tooling (Argo Rollouts, Flagger, Linkerd) uses 5 %
  as the standard rollback threshold — anything higher lets a bad
  v2 do meaningful damage before the rollout halts.
